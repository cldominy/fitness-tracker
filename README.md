# Fitness Tracker

[Deployed Application Link](https://fierce-island-40685.herokuapp.com/)

This website is a minimalistic application where users can create workouts, by creating either resistance or cardio exersizes, and storing information about them, such as duration, weight, and even reps & sets! By using Express to handle routing and MongoDB for the database, users can seamlessly update their day's workout and track their weekly progress in their dynamically generated dashboard.

# Installation Instructions

Since this is a functional website application, installation is not required to use the app. If you decided to clone the Repository, you will first need to download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). Once downloaded, open the server.js in the integrated terminal of VS code and run "npm i" to download all npms used. Additionally, you will need to have access to MongoDB and a GUI for it, such as Robo 3T, in order to create a local database.
